# Release notes

One file per tagged release, holding the published GitHub Release body
**verbatim** — no front matter, and no title heading, because the Releases page
renders the tag as the page `<h1>` and a `# vX.Y.Z` would duplicate it.

Publish, or republish after an edit, with:

```bash
gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md
```

Authoring here rather than in the web form is what makes each fix a diff and
each published body reproducible from a commit. The invariant is that this file
matches the published body — so an edit to the notes lands as a PR and is then
republished, never typed into the Release.

These files target GitHub's comment-flavour renderer, where a single newline
becomes a `<br>`. Do not hard-wrap paragraphs or list items; keep each on one
line however long it gets. In-page anchors do not work in a release body, since
headings there carry no `id` — refer to a section by name in bold instead.

## Where the contents come from

The `release-note` block in `.github/pull_request_template.md`, filled in when
the PR is opened. Collect the blocks since the previous tag and the change list
is already written; what is left is ordering it by what a reader needs first,
and writing the danger banner and the upgrade steps, which no per-PR note can
supply.

Reconstructing that list at tag time instead — from commit subjects, PR titles,
and diffs — is the expensive half of cutting a release. It also under-reports:
commit subjects name what was changed, not what it does to someone on the
previous version.

## Nothing here yet

There is no release. The first one ships when there is a binary and a hook that
fires; see [`docs/design/`](../design/) for what that has to include.
