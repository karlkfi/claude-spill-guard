"""queue.py — read, check, order and migrate a per-item backlog store.

One file per item under `docs/queue/`, priority held in each item's `rank`
key rather than in its position in a table. Items never share a file, so two
sessions editing different items cannot conflict, whatever the merge algorithm
and with no merge driver installed.

Subcommands:
  render    the ordered backlog — the read path, one call for the whole queue
  next      the top ready item, as a session kickoff prompt
  lint      check the store (frontmatter, ids, ranks, references)
  claims    check every id this branch adds holds a claim on the remote
  metrics   replay git history into flow metrics
  migrate   convert a legacy `docs/STATUS.md` Queue/Deferred table into items
  rank      compute an order key for an insertion

Ranks are base-36 order keys compared as plain strings, using the same
magnitude-head scheme as github-actions-gateway's queuestore, so a store
written by either tool reads and extends under the other. That package is on
an unmerged branch of the gateway as of 2026-08-16, not on its main.

# rot worth catching is a number pointing somewhere else entirely, which in the
# cases this was tuned against ran to tens of lines.
#
# The default rather than the value: `--citation-window` overrides it, because
# `--strict stale-citation` cannot. Promotion decides what a note costs and
# never what counts as one, so a caller that binds the class still cannot see a

# citation has drifted more than this*, not *citations are exact*.
CITATION_WINDOW = 10
# Marks a citation the row is *about* rather than one it relies on, and `lint`
# then reads none of it. A row quoting a pointer as its subject — a stale one
# kept as an exhibit, most of all — is the case where reporting drift is worse
# than missing it: the note for a resolvable pointer names the line the fragment
# moved to, so the checker hands a sweeping session a one-character repair that
# deletes the exhibit and passes every gate. Nothing else separates the two
# populations here. `check-positional-citations.py` tells its own exhibits apart
# by whether the match sits inside a code span, which cannot work for a citation
# that always does. The prefix goes inside the span, immediately before the
# path, so it travels when the citation is copied into another row.

# What `lint` reports rather than fails on, one name per class. A note is
# advisory because the store alone cannot settle what it found: a link at an

# the files, so failing on it would redden every store for the hours after any
# merge. A caller that needs certainty about one class asks for that class.
#
# Per class rather than one switch, because the classes have different callers
# and they disagree. An orchestrator linting a merged set wants `dangling-link`
# advisory precisely because that window is when links are legitimately in
# flight; a groom checking blockers wants certainty about its own class in the
# same run. One boolean makes each caller accept the other's promotion, and
# there is no reason for anyone to accept a class they did not ask for. For the

# --- rank algebra ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# A rank is an order key: a magnitude head, an integer part whose length the
# head fixes, and an optional fraction. Plain string comparison orders two
# ranks, so placing an item names a string between its neighbours and writes
# only that item's own file.
#
# The head is what keeps keys short. Midpointing alone never runs out but
# degrades exactly where this process pushes hardest: inserting below the
# smallest key prepends a digit every few insertions, and flakes-first sends
# every new flake to the top. A head lets the integer part step whole
# magnitudes instead — "a0" to "Zz" to "Zy" — so head and tail insertion cost
# no length at all until a magnitude is exhausted. Heads 'a'..'z' carry integer
# lengths 2..27 upward, 'Z'..'A' the same downward, and uppercase sorting below
# lowercase is what puts the descending magnitudes underneath.
#
# Ported from the Go implementation in karlkfi/github-actions-gateway's

# under the other. That path is on an unmerged branch there as of 2026-08-16,

# --- claims ---------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `alloc-queue-id.sh` reserves an ID by creating `refs/queue-ids/QN` on the
# remote, which binds only the sessions that call it. This is the other half:
# every ID a branch *adds* must hold a claim, so a number someone read off the
# store and incremented fails at the gate that files the row rather than at the
# rebase that collides with it.
#
# Three properties it is built around.
#
#   1. NEW IS MEASURED AGAINST THE MERGE BASE, NEVER origin/main's TIP. A row
#      `main` deleted while this branch was behind is absent from the tip and
#      present at the base, so against the tip it reads as one this branch
#      filed — and the rule would then demand a claim for finished work.
#   2. AN UNREADABLE REMOTE SKIPS RATHER THAN FAILS, so an offline clone still
#      runs the gate. `--strict` turns every skip into a failure, and CI — which
#      always has a network — is where it is passed. Without that, the one place
#      the check is guaranteed to run is also a place it can silently not run.
#   3. IT IS ITS OWN SUBCOMMAND. `lint` is a pure function of a directory: no
#      git, no network, correct against any store, which is what makes it safe
#      in an edit loop and in tests over temp dirs. This check is a function of
#      the *branch* instead, so folding it in would put a merge base and a
#      network round trip behind every one of those calls.
